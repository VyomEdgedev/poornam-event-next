            " What started as two passionate souls- Aadi Jain with an eye for flow, and Richi Anand Jain with a flair for beauty- soon grew into Poornam Events, a name whispered between families who wanted more than a checklist... they wanted a celebration that felt like them.",
            "We didn’t have celebrity clients or designer budgets at first- just unmatched energy, sleepless nights, and a vision to turn ordinary functions into unforgettable love stories. Since then, we’ve danced in baraats, fixed dupattas in mandaps, wiped happy tears, and even calmed a nervous groom or two. Every event has made us better- not just as planners, but as people.",
            "  Today, Poornam Events is not just a service- it’s a feeling, a family, a full-blown shaadi experience. And whether it’s your first function or final farewell, you’ll always find us in the background- smiling, managing, and making magic happen."
